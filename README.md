## What
- HabitOS is a mindful self-development web app designed to help users build consistent habits, track emotional well-being, and visualize progress over time. It combines habit streak tracking, mood journaling, interactive dashboards, and optional AI insights to promote long-term behavioral and emotional growth.

## Why

## Who
- Target users are students, young professionals, and self-improvement enthusiasts aged 18â€“35 who seek to build meaningful, consistent habits and better emotional clarity.
